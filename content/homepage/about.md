bio: This symbol represents **a world piece computer**. The emblem that represents a world piece computer is an extension of the symbol used for a world piece. It incorporates a 'C' to denote its computational aspect. This emblem is a visual representation of the integration of world pieces into a computational system. The 'C' appended to the world piece symbol signifies the computational processes that occur within a world piece computer, which include the optimization of piece arrangements and the facilitation of the operator's objectives. This symbol is trademarked, but not registered.

## Some characteristics of a world piece computer:

## Term Overview:

A world piece computer is a concept that might seem complex at first, but we can break it down into simpler terms. Imagine a world piece computer as a system that helps a person organize and optimize various elements of their life and community to achieve a harmonious and peaceful existence, specifically as a continuous process.

To start, let's define some terms:

- **a world piece:** This refers to the individual components or elements---the significant _things_---that make up your world. These can be physical objects, like your home or your favorite park, or abstract concepts like your values and beliefs.

- **the universal piece:** This is the overarching computational peace process that connects all the world pieces together. It is the overall process that a world piece computer helps 'run'. It’s a continuous, evolutionary, and iterative process aimed at generating more / better peace products that we usually think of when we think 'peace'.

- **The Human Imperative:** This is a constitution---a guiding framework---that specifies the fundamental operation of world piece computers. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the universal piece by operating world piece computers. The Human Imperative is all about ensuring that our actions contribute to global peace as the resulting effect of maintaining the computational peace process.

Now, a world piece computer is essentially a system that the person operating creates by identifying and integrating world pieces. For example, if you consider your home a world piece, you would look at how it functions, what it needs to be sustainable, and how it interacts with other world pieces like your workplace or community center, etc.

The goal is to optimize these interactions and piece configurations to create an environment conducive to producing those 'peace products' we usually think of. This involves defining a prosperity mission, which is the computer operator's personal or community goal for well-being and success, then aligning this mission with the Human Imperative.

When many individuals and communities create their own world piece computers and connect them, they form a network. This network is what we call the universal piece computer. It’s like a giant supercomputer made up of all these interconnected systems, working together to maintain the universal piece, peace as a continuous computational process.

Overall, a world piece computer is a distributed system of technologies, constructs, and people. It is built for organizing and optimizing all significant things in a person's world. When connected with other piece computers, it becomes by definition, part of the universal piece computer, a computational peace network aimed at achieving and maintaining global peace through continuous and collaborative process efforts.

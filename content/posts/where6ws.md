The following expounds on this simple answer.

Groups of humans are also significant, so one computer is centered about the effective (and immediate) leader of each group.

So, where is your personal world piece computer located? Yours is right there where you are right now (unless of course, you are actively dissociating at the moment). The center is you, and all your world pieces are scattered throughout your surrounding environmen. Some of your pieces are even abstract and logical, located at different places within your mind. (For an example, an education is a world piece that is represented by a piece of paper diploma, living wholly in one's head.)

  <p>This post contains loose and long form thoughts about the world piece computer. The purpose of writing this post is to &lsquo;get it out&rsquo;, to be distilled later into a more concise documentation article. World piece computer will be abbreviated using <em><strong>wpc</strong></em>, pronounced <em>dub-pc</em>.</p>
<h2 id="overview">overview</h2>
<p><em>When</em> is the least important of the 6 common interrogative-correlatives. This is only because time is the most pervasive concept we contend with. Everything depends on time, so from a god-mode perspective, when is the <strong>most</strong> important correlative. We are not omnipresent however, so we must limit our scope to remain effective and competent rational actors. In reality though, we must always keep in mind that</p>
<p>The question we need to ask <em>here</em> is <em>when</em> is a world piece computer relevant? What is its scope in terms of time?</p>
<p>We can break this question into qualitative categories, so let&rsquo;s do that. We have: how often, how long or short, how fast or slow, beginning and ending, &hellip; etc etc.</p>
<h2 id="how-often">how often</h2>
<p><em>How often</em> is tied at the hip to <em>how many</em>.</p>
<p>At first approach, we ask how often world piece computers happen. Bearing in mind that the essential piece or component that defines a world piece computer is a <strong>human brain</strong>, and that said brain exists to manage pieces in that human&rsquo;s world, every human on the planet has their own world piece computer. This implies that every time somebody dies, a wpc shuts down forever. Every time somebody is born, a wpc with limited time is powered up. This is the baseline frequency. World piece computers at the core of it all, represent <em>individuals and their surroundings</em>. And, in a general sense, we must bear in mind that a world piece computer is primative form is a naturally occuring object.</p>
<p><em><strong>This approach is rather specific, because it is an anthropic view of the world. This means that the view sees the surrounding universe through the lens of intelligent life, or humanity. In a general sense, all these conclusions become more extreme, because &lsquo;brain&rsquo; is no longer limited to <strong>humans</strong>, rather &lsquo;brain&rsquo; becomes any system capable of intelligence. So as an extreme example, a single particle of hydrogen has a brain because by the combination of inertia, gravitation, electromagnetism, then the surrounding environment and all the pieces contained within, this single particle &lsquo;responds&rsquo; to its surroundings by following a very specific ruleset rooted in energy conservation and action minimization principles. All the pieces in this hydrogen atom&rsquo;s world contribute to the hydrogen atom&rsquo;s world piece computer as a whole, and this informs the atom&rsquo;s evolution through spacetime. But those extremes are a different conversation more on the topic of first principles.</strong></em></p>
<p>In addition to this frequency, world piece computers can <strong>also</strong> represent communities, or units of humans such as the nuclear family unit. In general, it is almost certain that a pure democracy is not practically possible, AND, in any given instant, a community is led by a single human (though in cases like pure democracy, this single leading human can change very frequently). Individuals exert influence over one another, and it is this constant vying for &lsquo;power&rsquo; that determines <em>who</em> gets to lead in a given moment. A world piece computer is defined in terms of a <strong>single</strong> human brain, but in the case of a community unit this brain can cycle and switch as the community deems appropriate. The key factor here is that although the brains that take turns leading are not singular, a community is a singular entity that only has room for one brain at a time.</p>
<p>So really it&rsquo;s like, the singular community defines the need for a brain to lead it. In the case of a single person, the individual world pieces within that human&rsquo;s world &ndash; and the ambient environment itself &ndash; are the singular thing that defines the need for a brain. This single physical brain may actually have many brains living within it who take turns exerting control. This is equivalent to the community case, though the individual is more physically singular, whereas the community is more logically singular.</p>
<p>All this is to say that a world piece computer exists <em>apparently (ie obviously)</em> as one per individual human being, and one per unique individual community unit or human relationship unit (two people, for example, may form their own world piece computer). This means that the number of naturally occuring world piece computers on the planet is &gt; &gt; &gt; (much much much greater than) 8 billion.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, this means world piece computers happen all the time, almost continuously in fact. They are constantly popping in and out of existence like subatomic particles. The number is so staggering large that the discrete instances blur together forming a <em>continuum</em>, basically a fluid blur of movement and action.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-or-short">how long or short</h2>
<p>In a strict sense, world piece computers are constantly appearing and disappearing, even if nobody is birthing or dying. Any time a group forms, a crude world piece computer forms. When it dissolves, the computer dissolves. In the opposite direction, even if people are birthing and dying, a single world piece computer may persist without significant existential threat. An example of this would be a nation state, or a specific kind of people.</p>
<p>Returning to the note on extremes outlined above, if we take a general approach to this topic, we see that world piece computers are so often on short timescales and to permanent on long timescales, that it begins to feel like the construct is as pervasive and frequent as the air bumping around surrounding us. [bullshit factor == med/high]]</p>
<p>Being repetitive, the answer to &lsquo;how long or short&rsquo;, and &lsquo;how often&rsquo; is &lsquo;all the time&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="how-fast-or-slow">how fast or slow</h2>
<p>The frequency of world piece computer operation, like anything, will largely depend on the size of a given world piece computer. In general, the larger something (with mass) is the more inertia it has, and thus the harder time it has changing direction of motion. A small world piece computer, such as a simple world with a simple human brain operating it, is liable to be much more agile and responsive. [high bs factor] What is the point of this paragraph? Basically, this is a situation similar to that of electromagnetic radiation and inductive objects. The lowest frequency that an antenna can pick up is radiation with a wavelength of twice the length of the antenna [check this]. This means that anything vibrating or happening <em>slower</em> than this corresponding frequency is not possible to detect with the antenna. I don&rsquo;t mean to compare world piece computers directly to antennas, but I do mean to use them to illustrate how a tiny individual human&rsquo;s world piece computer will only be capable of operating <em>at slowest</em> a frequency of one lifetime cycle. [too esoteric]</p>
<p>So, much larger world piece computers will be capable of operating frequencies much lower than that of individual human world piece computers. This is simply because entities such as institutions and societies and people have longer lifespans than the individuals who comprise them.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that because each world piece is its own world piece computer (in terms of that piece&rsquo;s world) a large world piece computer is capable of operating frequencies as high as capable by the smallest world pieces it contains. All world piece computers are effectively made of the same kinds of fundamental pieces, so the largest computers are (in general, but not absolutely) capable of operating at all the high frequencies that small computers are capable of, but the small computers are strictly NOT capable of operating frequencies lower than their lifetime size. This is a constraint that will need to be kept in mind for any serious design efforts.</p>
<p>The above three paragraphs are poorly jointed, redo.</p>
<h2 id="beginning-and-ending">beginning and ending</h2>
<p>When do world piece computers begin and when do they end? Beginning is easy. Basically anytime something capable of responding to it&rsquo;s surrounding environment is born, a world piece computer is powered on. When two people engage in a relationship, they become capable of interacting with their surrounding environment in unison, thus a new world piece computer is born containing the combined pieces from those two individual worlds.</p>
<p>What happens though is this relationship with two people ends? Well then their world piece computer powers down. Things get muddy when we start trying to define what it means to terminate a world piece computer. When a community of 100 people lose 51 people, does said community cease to exist as a world piece computer? Answering this question depends on answering the questions of &lsquo;what is the clear and defining feature that a world computer DOES?&rsquo; This is beyond the immediate scope of this post so I will defer it to an earlier post (this post written first).</p>
<p>We can still give a jab at answering: according to the first paragraph in this section, the moment a computer stops being able to effectively respond to its surrounding environment, it ceases to be. At the individual level, a person in a coma does not have a functioning world piece computer. Likewise, zombies do not have functioning world piece computers (a zombie is only capable of <em><strong>reacting</strong></em> to its surrounding environment). At the community level, we need to speak in terms of effective response. At first glance, and effective response is one that is capable of serving the computer&rsquo;s deliberate interests. An ineffective response is more like a reaction. At this point things get too fuzzy and it&rsquo;s time to yank the eject lever on this paragraph.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>More to come.</p>
